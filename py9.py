#WHILE LOOPS IN PYTHON!
#while = a statement which runs it's block of code, as long as it'S condition remains true!

#while 1==1:
 #   print("help! i'm stuck in a loop!") #this is an infinite loop there is no escape from this!

#name = ""
#while len(name)==0:
 #   name = input("enter your name: ")

#print("hello "+name)

#while 1==1:
#    print("pls don't spam sh!t")

#name = ""

#while len(name) == 0:
#    name = input("enter your name:")

#print("hello "+name)

# another way of writing this

#name = None

#while not name:
#    name = input("enter your name: ")

#print("Hello "+name)

# for loop = a statement that execute it's block of code a limited amount of times
#             while = ulimited! on cnditions
#             for = limited!


#for i in range(10):
 #   print(i+1)

#for i in range(100):
#    print(i+1)

#for i in range(25,105,10):
    #in range function you can add 3rd argument
    #step: you can  add how much you wanna count up or count down (here it's 10 up)
#    print(i)
#***#benefit of for loop is we can iterate anything that can iterable!***

#for i in "Nissan":  #str this time!
##    print(i)

#for i in "mossow":
#    print(i)
